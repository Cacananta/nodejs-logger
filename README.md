# Node.js Logger

In this exercise I created my own logger for specific header information (requests and responses). There are quite a few logger plug-ins that can accomplish the same thing but creating my own really helped solidify my knowledge of the Express API and the information that is passed from clients to server (and vice versa).

## Using this Repo

There isn't a lot to play around with. Take a look at my logger and the corresponding .csv output.
